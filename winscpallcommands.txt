### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example of a WinSCP script:

```cmd
open sftp://user:password@example.com
option transfer binary
put localfile.txt /remotepath/
close
exit
```

This script connects to a remote server, uploads a file in binary mode, and then closes the connection.

These commands can be combined in various ways to create powerful automation scripts for file transfer and remote server management.
