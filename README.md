# WinSCP Automation Script Project

This project demonstrates how to automate file transfers between a local machine and a remote server using WinSCP's scripting capabilities. The project includes a script that connects to an SFTP server, downloads a file, and uploads a new file to the server. The process is executed via a batch file.

## Project Structure

- **transfer-files.txt**: This is the WinSCP script that handles the file transfer operations. It includes commands to connect to the SFTP server, navigate directories, download files, and upload files.
- **run-winscp.bat**: A batch file that runs the WinSCP script using the `WinSCP.com` command-line tool. It ensures that the script is executed correctly and pauses the output to display any messages.

## How It Works

1. **Script Execution**: The `transfer-files.txt` script contains the necessary commands to:
   - Connect to an SFTP server using provided credentials and host details.
   - Navigate to the specified remote directory.
   - Download a file from the remote server to a local directory.
   - Upload a new file from the local directory to the remote server.
   - Close the connection.

2. **Running the Batch File**: The `run-winscp.bat` batch file triggers the execution of the `transfer-files.txt` script using the `WinSCP.com` command-line utility. It also pauses at the end to allow you to review any output or errors.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- **WinSCP**: Make sure WinSCP is installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php).
- **Git**: If you plan to work with GitHub or other Git repositories, ensure Git is installed. Download it [here](https://git-scm.com/).
- **SFTP Server Access**: You need valid credentials and access to an SFTP server.

### Steps to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you're working with GitHub, clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/winscp-automation.git
   cd winscp-automation
   ```

2. **Edit the Script**: Open the `transfer-files.txt` file and update the following with your own details:
   - **`username`**: Your SFTP username.
   - **`password`**: Your SFTP password.
   - **`host.example.com`**: Replace with your actual host address.
   - **File paths**: Update the file paths in the script to match your local and remote directories.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the batch file to run the script.
   - Open a command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
   - Type `run-winscp.bat` and press Enter.

4. **Review the Output**: The batch file pauses after running the script, allowing you to review any output messages or errors.

### Example

Here is an example command in the `transfer-files.txt` script:
```plaintext
open sftp://username:password@host.example.com -hostkey="ssh-rsa 2048 xxxxxxxxxxx..."
cd /remote/path
get remote-file.txt C:\local\path\downloaded-file.txt
put C:\local\path\new-file.txt remote-file.txt
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure that the SFTP server credentials and host details are correct. You can test your connection using the WinSCP GUI before running the script.
- **File Paths**: Verify that the file paths in the script are accurate and accessible.
- **WinSCP Installation**: Ensure that `WinSCP.com` is correctly installed and the path in `run-winscp.bat` points to it.
